## apt-file

Search in what package is a library

## Example

To solve this kind of issue:

`XXX: error while loading shared libraries: libSDL_ttf-2.0.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory`

You can run :

`sudo apt-file search libSDL_ttf-2.0.so.0`

Which will display what packages contain the needed library

Note: to populate the cache after install, you need to run:
`sudo apt-file update`
