# PDF MANIPULATION TOOL

## USAGE

To concatenate two pdfs (cat) :
`pdftk first.pdf second.pdf cat output merged.pdf` create a new pdf with second.pdf appended to first.pdf

Selecting a subset of pages is possible:
`pdftk A=one.pdf B=two.pdf cat A1-7 B1-5 A8-end output combined.pdf` (note: both bounds are included when giving a range, ie A1-2 gives pages 1&2)
